5. Technical Architecture
5.1. High-Level Components
Frontend:

UI Framework:

Use shadcn for consistent and accessible UI components.

Style with Tailwind CSS for responsive, utility-first design.

Charting:

Integrate Ant Design Charts for interactive data visualization.

State Management:

Implement state management via a suitable framework (e.g., Zustand or Redux) to handle dashboard state, widget configuration, and user sessions.

Backend:

API Layer:

RESTful endpoints to manage and serve data for connections, datasets, dashboards, and widgets.

Data Adapters:

Modular adapters for various data sources (CSV, REST, SQL).

AI Integration:

Middleware or microservices to handle AI requests for the Copilot feature.

Database:

Technology agnostic – use any relational or NoSQL database; schema definitions and migrations should be abstracted.

5.2. Deployment & Environment
Deployment:

Ensure the application is containerized (e.g., Docker) for consistent environments.

Support deployment on various cloud platforms.

CI/CD:

Implement automated testing and deployment pipelines.

Environment Configuration:

6. UI/UX Design
6.1. User Interface Guidelines
Component Library:

All UI components must adhere to the shadcn schema for a consistent look and feel.

Styling:

Use Tailwind CSS for layout, spacing, typography, and responsiveness.

Charting:

All visualizations must be implemented using Ant Design Charts. Ensure proper configuration for different chart types and interactive features (tooltips, legends, filters).

8. Assumptions & Dependencies
Assumptions:

Users have existing data sources that can be connected via standard protocols (CSV, REST, SQL).

The system will support standard browser environments and modern devices.

Dependencies:

Third-party libraries for UI (shadcn, Tailwind CSS, Ant Design Charts).

External APIs for AI assistance.

Authentication providers (e.g., Clerk) and database services.

9. Risks & Mitigation
Integration Complexity:

Mitigation: Modular data adapters and thorough testing for each integration.

Performance Bottlenecks:

Risk: Real-time data updates and AI processing may slow the system.

Mitigation: Optimize API endpoints and consider caching strategies.

Security Vulnerabilities:

Risk: Exposing sensitive data through APIs.

Mitigation: Enforce strict authentication, use HTTPS, and implement regular security audits.

10. Deliverables
