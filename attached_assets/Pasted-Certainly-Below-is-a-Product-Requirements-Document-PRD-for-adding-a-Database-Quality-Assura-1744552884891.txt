# **Product Requirements Document (PRD)**
### **Project:** Database Quality Assurance (DB QA) Section for Beak Dash

**Author:** [Your Name]  
**Date:** [Date]

---

### **Overview**

We are enhancing Beak Dash by adding a **Database Quality Assurance (DB QA)** section to help users ensure the integrity, completeness, and quality of the data within their connected databases. The new section will allow users to define and run database quality checks (KPIs), build queries, view results, and generate reports or alerts based on quality metrics.

---

### **Objective**

To provide users with a user-friendly interface where they can:
1. Access and view the DB QA dashboard.
2. Select a **category** of database quality checks (e.g., Completeness, Consistency, Timeliness, etc.).
3. Build, save, and execute custom database queries.
4. View the results of the quality checks, including visualizations.
5. Automate the execution of checks and reports.

### **Key Features**

1. **DB QA Section in the Left Panel**
   - Add a **new section in the left navigation panel** of Beak Dash called **“DB QA”**.
   - This section will be **clickable** and will open a page dedicated to database quality checks.

2. **DB QA Categories**
   - The page will have **tabs** (top or sidebar) for various **data quality categories** that users can click to navigate.
   - Categories include:
     - **Data Completeness**
     - **Data Consistency**
     - **Data Accuracy**
     - **Data Integrity**
     - **Data Timeliness**
     - **Data Uniqueness**
     - **Data Relationship**
     - **Sensitive Data Exposure**
   - Alternatively, the categories can be listed in a **dropdown** menu on the side or top of the page to allow easy switching.

3. **Query Builder Interface**
   - The page corresponding to each category will have an **intuitive interface** for the user to **build custom queries** to validate data quality.
   - Users can select tables and columns from connected databases using a **drag-and-drop interface**.
   - Users can create conditions for metrics (e.g., “Check for null values in field `email`” or “Check if `start_date > end_date`”).
   - Users will also have the option to write custom SQL queries if they prefer advanced options.
   - A **query validation** feature will check for any errors before execution.
   - **Save queries**: Users can save frequently used queries for future use.

4. **Results & Visualizations**
   - After executing the queries, the system will **display the results** in an easy-to-read format (tables, charts, graphs).
   - **Visualizations**: Display metrics as bar charts, pie charts, or line graphs to track data quality over time or across tables.
   - Results will be **downloadable** in CSV, Excel, or PDF formats.

5. **Automated Reports & Dashboards**
   - Users can set up **scheduled reports** for specific queries to be executed automatically at set intervals (e.g., daily, weekly).
   - A **DB QA dashboard** will display the status of all quality checks across selected categories, including:
     - A summary of results.
     - Alerts when predefined thresholds are breached.
     - KPIs showing the percentage of success/failure.

6. **Alerts & Notifications**
   - Users can set **email alerts** or **push notifications** when a query result breaches a threshold (e.g., “Null values > 10% in required fields”).
   - Users will be able to configure alerts for different conditions, including:
     - **Thresholds for KPIs** (e.g., if data completeness drops below 90%).
     - **Failure of query execution** (e.g., syntax or connection issues).

7. **Execution Logs**
   - Each query execution will have an **execution log** that displays:
     - Time of execution.
     - Query status (success/failure).
     - The number of records processed.
     - Any issues encountered during execution (e.g., query errors).

### **User Stories**

#### **1. As a user, I want to access a DB QA section in Beak Dash so that I can start running quality checks on my database.**

- **Acceptance Criteria**: 
  - There is a clearly labeled **DB QA** section in the left panel.
  - Upon clicking **DB QA**, the user is taken to a page with available categories for quality checks.

#### **2. As a user, I want to select a data quality category (e.g., Data Completeness) so that I can perform specific checks related to that category.**

- **Acceptance Criteria**: 
  - The categories (e.g., Data Completeness, Data Consistency) are displayed as clickable tabs on top or in a dropdown on the sidebar.
  - Each category page loads relevant data quality checks specific to that category.

#### **3. As a user, I want to create and execute queries for quality checks, so that I can validate the data in my database.**

- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - The user can select tables and fields from the database.
  - The user can build simple or complex queries using a graphical interface or custom SQL.
  - The user can execute the query and view the results in a readable format.
  - The user can save queries for future use.

#### **4. As a user, I want to visualize query results so that I can understand data quality metrics easily.**

- **Acceptance Criteria**: 
  - After executing a query, the system displays results in tabular format, and if appropriate, visualizes them with charts or graphs (e.g., pie charts, bar graphs).
  - The results can be downloaded in CSV or Excel format.

#### **5. As a user, I want to automate query execution and receive alerts, so that I am notified of data quality issues without needing to check manually.**

- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - The user can set up recurring query execution (e.g., daily, weekly).
  - The user can configure alerts for query results based on predefined thresholds (e.g., if completeness < 90%).
  - Alerts are sent by email or within the application.

### **Wireframes and Design Notes**

- **Left Panel**:
  - Add a new **DB QA** section below existing sections.
  - When clicked, the **DB QA** section expands to show categories or a dropdown.

- **Main Page (DB QA)**:
  - A header with **tabs** for each category or a sidebar dropdown for categories.
  - For each category, a **query builder** interface is shown to the user with options to select tables, columns, and conditions.
  - Include a **results panel** below or to the right for visualizing query outputs (tables, graphs, etc.).
  - **Save Query** button for storing frequently used queries.

- **Dashboard**:
  - Show real-time data quality status with color-coded KPI indicators (green for good, yellow for warning, red for failure).
  - Display quick stats on common issues (e.g., missing data, data type mismatches).

---

### **Non-Functional Requirements**

1. **Performance**: Query execution and result loading should be efficient, even for large datasets.
2. **Scalability**: The system must handle multiple databases and a large number of queries and checks.
3. **Security**: Ensure that sensitive data (e.g., customer info) is protected in both the UI and backend. Use encryption and proper access controls.

---

### **Acceptance Criteria**

- A user can navigate to the **DB QA** section, select a category, build and execute queries, and view results.
- The system should allow users to **save queries** and **automate** their execution.
- **Reports and alerts** should be customizable and functional.
- **Visualizations** should clearly display the quality metrics for each query.
- The **UI** should be intuitive and responsive across devices.

### **Milestones**

1. **Design and UI/UX Mockups**: 1 week
2. **Backend Development**: 3 weeks
3. **Frontend Development**: 3 weeks
4. **QA and Testing**: 2 weeks
5. **Deployment and Documentation**: 1 week

### **Conclusion**

This feature will allow users to ensure the quality of their database by providing an easy way to check data completeness, accuracy, integrity, and other key metrics. The added **DB QA** section will integrate seamlessly into the Beak Dash interface and provide both advanced and user-friendly options for quality assurance.
